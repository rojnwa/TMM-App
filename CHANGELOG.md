## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-15

Point release on top of v1.0.1: multiple Teslas in one Bluetooth gate,
navigation to whichever car is actually connected, and a fix for fake
addresses colliding with Telegram anonymous numbers.

### Added
- **Multi-Tesla.** The **Tesla connection** card (Settings → Forwarding, and the setup
  guide) now lets you select **every Tesla you drive** from the paired Bluetooth devices
  (checkbox picker with *Apply*). Messages and Grok are forwarded while **any** of the
  selected cars is connected; each row shows its state (*Connected*, no longer paired)
  and its own *Remove* button. An existing single-device selection is migrated
  automatically.
- **Navigation goes to the car you're in.** In the **Tesla Fleet API** card every
  vehicle gets a *Link Bluetooth device* button. Once a vehicle is linked to its
  Bluetooth device, Grok's `tesla_navigate` sends the destination to the **connected**
  car; the radio-selected vehicle is now the **default vehicle** and only used as a
  fallback (no linked car connected, desk testing, self-test). Links are cleared on
  Tesla logout. The diagnostics export counts configured devices and links (no MACs,
  names or VINs).

### Changed
- The Grok self-test's "Tesla" stage now reports *vehicle configured* when either a
  default vehicle is selected **or** at least one device is linked.
- Downgrading to an older version after this update drops the Bluetooth device
  selection (the old single-device keys are removed on the first change); forwarding
  then falls back to 24/7 as before.

### Fixed
- **Wake-up targeted the wrong car.** `wake_up` for a sleeping vehicle used the globally
  selected vehicle id regardless of the VIN being commanded; it now uses the id of the
  addressed vehicle (looked up via the vehicle list if unknown).
- **Fake addresses are one digit longer: `+888` + channel digit + 8-digit ID (13 chars).**
  The old 8-digit form (`+888 XXXX XXXX`) is exactly the shape of Telegram/Fragment
  anonymous numbers, so Telegram's contact sync matched the hidden bridge contacts to
  strangers' accounts and showed them as chats named after your conversations. Existing
  mappings migrate on next use, bridge contacts are rebuilt once on first start after the
  update (the car re-pulls its phonebook), and replies to threads still carrying the old
  address keep routing.

### Internal
- The contacts authenticator account type is derived from the `applicationId`, so the debug
  build (`.debug`) can create its own bridge contacts next to an installed release build.
  The release type string is unchanged.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-19

Maintenance release on top of v1.0.0, focused on managing the in-app SMS inbox,
plus one UI fix.

### Added
- **Delete whole conversations.** Long-press a thread in the SMS list to delete it,
  behind a confirmation dialog.
- **Swipe-to-delete single messages.** Swipe a message bubble to remove just that
  message, behind a confirmation dialog.
- **Unread SMS badge.** The bottom-bar SMS tab now shows a live unread-message count.

### Fixed
- **Bluetooth device picker** list is now scrollable, so every paired device stays
  reachable on long lists.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-12 — "The Big One"

First stable release. It brings the entire 0.7.x/0.8.x development line to a stable
footing on top of the rc1/rc2 message-bridge hardening. Highlights since v0.6.0:

### Added
- **In-car navigation via Grok.** Dictate a destination and Grok sends it to your Tesla
  through the official **Fleet API** (`TeslaNavigateTool`), confirming the target out loud.
- **Bring-your-own credentials.** You provide your own Tesla Fleet API and xAI keys in
  Settings; both are AES-256-GCM encrypted with an AndroidKeyStore master key — nothing is
  ever bundled with the app.
- **Grok location context (opt-in).** With explicit consent your current position is shared
  with Grok for location-aware answers; off by default, behind a proper permission flow.
- **Forward only while connected to your Tesla + toggleable daily limit** (0.7.0/0.7.1):
  pick your car once; messages inject only while it's connected; the daily cap can be off.
- **Grok in-app self-test.** A staged diagnostics card (key → position → Tesla → end-to-end)
  verifies the assistant without driving, in EN + DE.

### Changed
- **Messenger-bridge hardening** (rc1/rc2): group-summary notifications filtered, own sent
  replies no longer read back, action-less updates can't clobber a replyable mapping,
  quick-reply fallback opens TMM's own composer, incoming-SMS notifications show the contact
  name, long-press starts native text selection with copy + tappable links.

### Security / Privacy
- Diagnostics export masks the VIN to its last 4 chars and strips destination, GPS and VIN
  from Fleet API logging; message bodies and dictations are never logged.

## [1.0.0-rc2] — 2026-07-11

Second release candidate: two field reports from rc1 testing.

### Fixed
- **Incoming-SMS notifications now show the contact's name** instead of the raw phone
  number, using the same contact lookup as the in-app conversation list (falls back to
  the number without contacts permission or without a match).

### Changed
- **Long-pressing a message bubble now starts text selection** — select any part of a
  message (e.g. a 2FA code) directly in the bubble and copy it via the system toolbar;
  previously long-press always copied the entire message.

## [1.0.0-rc1] — 2026-07-10

Release candidate for 1.0. Fixes the field-reported WhatsApp bridge failures
(root-cause analysis in `issue-reports/analyse-report-2026-07-10.md`).

### Fixed
- **1:1 replies no longer fail with "Reply not delivered".** WhatsApp's group-summary
  notification (which has no reply action) was captured like a message and overwrote the
  mapping's notification pointer; it is now filtered out, and an action-less update can
  no longer overwrite a replyable mapping payload.
- **Your own replies are no longer read back as new messages.** The messenger's
  notification re-post containing your just-sent reply is recognized (self-authored
  message skip + short-lived sent-reply ledger) and dropped instead of injected.
- **The quick-reply fallback notification now opens TMM's own compose screen** prefilled
  with recipient and text, instead of Google Messages (which only showed its
  "set default SMS app" prompt while TMM holds the SMS role).
- **Diagnostics log spam:** stale real-SMS rows are no longer re-logged on every
  SMS-provider change, and the reply-rebuilder log no longer claims "found-action"
  before actually checking for a reply action.

### Added
- **Links in SMS messages are now tappable** in the app's conversation view.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-24

Robustness pass on the v0.7.0 Bluetooth/budget features, from a multi-agent review.

### Added
- **The Grok assistant now respects the Tesla-connection gate too.** A dictated question is
  only answered while the phone is connected to your selected Tesla — the check runs *before*
  the xAI call, so leaving the car between dictation and answer no longer spends tokens or
  injects a stray reply. (The "start AI chat" button stays car-independent for desk testing.)
- **Stale-device warning.** If your selected Tesla is no longer paired (unpaired, reset), the
  Tesla-connection card now shows a warning instead of silently dropping every message.
- **"Open app settings" fallback** when the Bluetooth permission is permanently denied, so the
  Grant button is never a dead end (both Settings and the setup guide).
- **First unit tests for the connection checker** (`BluetoothConnectionCheckerTest`) covering the
  fail-open contract, plus a Grok "not connected → skip" test.

### Changed
- **More reliable connection detection.** In addition to the HFP/A2DP audio profiles, the app now
  tracks Bluetooth ACL connect/disconnect events — so a Tesla that's connected for messages but
  not currently the audio sink is still recognised as "connected" (fewer false drops).
- The device picker now **pre-selects your current device** and shows a brief loading state instead
  of flashing "no paired devices".
- Your selected device can always be **removed**, even if the Bluetooth permission was later revoked.
- The Home screen shows **"N (unlimited)"** for forwarded-today when the daily limit is switched off,
  instead of a misleading "N / limit".
- "Restart setup" now leaves a **clean back stack** (no duplicate Home, back exits properly).
- The disconnected-drop diagnostic log is written **once per disconnect**, not per message.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Forward only while connected to your Tesla.** A new **Settings → Forwarding → "Tesla
  connection"** card lets you pick your car once from the paired Bluetooth devices. From
  then on, messenger notifications are injected as fake SMS **only while that device is
  connected** — so being away from the car no longer fills the daily limit with messages
  you can't hear anyway. When not connected, the message is dropped (no buffering). The
  check runs before the daily-limit reserve, so a disconnected phone never burns budget.
  Requires the **BLUETOOTH_CONNECT** permission (requested from the same card). Until a
  device is selected — or if the permission isn't granted — forwarding behaves as before
  (24/7), so nothing silently stops working before you've set it up. The same picker also
  appears as an optional step in the **setup guide**.
- **Developer settings → "Restart setup".** A button in the developer section reopens the
  setup guide so you can review the steps after first-run; your existing setup is kept
  (the onboarding flag is not reset).
- **Daily limit can be switched off.** The **Settings → Forwarding → "Daily limit"** card
  now has an on/off switch (**on by default**). Turning it off shows a warning explaining
  the risks — without a cap, a misbehaving messenger could write unlimited fake SMS into
  the message database, and in the unlikely event a carrier delivers the `+888` reply SMS,
  reply costs would be uncapped. While off, the limit slider and today's count are hidden.

### Changed
- The inbound capture pipeline (`NotificationCapture`) gained a Bluetooth-connection gate
  between the default-SMS-role check and the send-budget reserve. `SendBudget` is now a
  no-op (always allows, never counts) when the daily limit is switched off.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Internet access for Grok (web search + X/Twitter search).** Two new opt-in toggles in
  the **Grok assistant** settings let Grok look things up live while you drive — *Allow
  internet access (web search)* and *Allow X/Twitter search*. Both are **off by default**.
  When on, your dictated question is answered with current information (weather, news,
  prices, live discussion) via xAI's native server-side search; the whole search runs on
  xAI's side and comes back as one spoken reply. The dictation goes to the **same xAI** as a
  normal reply (no second service, no second key), still with `store: false`. Note that
  searches cost extra — xAI bills tokens **plus** each successful search, and one question
  can trigger several — which is why it stays opt-in.
- **One-tap diagnostics export.** A new **Settings → Support → "Send diagnostics"**
  button (no developer mode required) writes a single redacted log file and opens the
  Android share sheet — so a tester can send **one file** to the maintainer and nothing
  else. The export bundles build/version info, settings, mappings, reply history and
  the **persistent** event log in one JSON. All personal data is removed: contact names
  are masked (`•••(len=N)`), conversation keys are hashed (schema prefix kept), and reply
  text is reduced to its length. **The file contains no message contents.** The detailed
  Diagnostics screen's toolbar action is now a **Share** button (was a local-only export).

### Changed
- With a search toggle on, Grok's behaviour prompt now tells it that it **can** look things
  up live (instead of the old "no live tools" wording), while still never reading out URLs,
  citation markers or markdown. Inline citations are disabled at the source and the spoken
  text is additionally cleaned of any links/URLs so nothing gibberish gets read aloud.
- **The diagnostics log is now persistent** — a rolling on-disk file (~4 MB, in
  `filesDir`) instead of in-memory only, so the export survives app restarts and long
  drives. The in-memory live-log tail is reloaded from disk on start.
- **More of the reply pipeline is logged** (and exportable): `NotificationReplyExecutor`
  now records each outcome branch (success via cache/rebuild, no action, no remote input,
  pending-intent canceled with reason, provider error) and `PendingIntentRebuilder`
  records the notification-listener / active-notification state. This makes "Reply not
  delivered" cases diagnosable from the exported file alone.

### Fixed
- **Privacy:** a contact name that was previously written to the in-memory log on capture
  is no longer logged (the log is exportable). Only metadata/lengths are logged.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Local xAI API-key test.** A new **“Test key”** button in the **Grok assistant**
  settings (next to Save / Remove) checks whether the stored xAI key actually works —
  entirely on the phone, with **no Bluetooth or Tesla connection**. It sends a single
  minimal request to the xAI API and shows a colour-coded result: **green** = key valid;
  **red** = key rejected (auth error), no network, or server error; **yellow** = timeout
  or rate-limited. The ping goes against the default model (so a custom model name can’t
  be mistaken for an invalid key) and sends no personal data — just a fixed `"ping"` — so
  it can be used to validate the key during setup, before privacy consent is granted.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **English + German, with an in-app language switcher.** The whole interface is now
  fully localized — it was German-only before. **Settings → Language** offers
  **System / Deutsch / English**, and the same choice is exposed through the Android 13+
  per-app language picker (**Settings › Apps › TMM › Language**); the two stay in sync.
  English is the fallback for other system languages, while existing users keep German.
- **Localized Grok assistant.** The assistant’s spoken answers, status and error
  messages, and the default system prompt and welcome now follow the app language, so an
  English UI yields English replies read aloud. A system prompt or welcome you have
  customized is preserved across a language change; only an unedited default flips along
  with the language.

### Changed
- All user-facing text — screens, notifications, notification-channel names, toasts and
  the read-aloud Grok strings — now resolves through string resources / the active per-app
  locale instead of hard-coded German. Notification-channel names refresh on a language
  change from either the in-app switch or the OS picker, and SMS-bubble timestamps follow
  the chosen language.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Standard SMS support.** Now that the app is the default SMS app, it doubles as a
  real SMS client:
  - **Inbox / history** — a new **“SMS”** bottom-nav tab shows real conversations read
    directly from `content://sms`, grouped by thread, with contact-name resolution. The
    `+888…` Tesla-bridge messages are filtered out so they never appear here.
  - **Send** — compose new messages and reply to real SMS straight from the app. Incoming
    messages are marked read when their thread is opened (scoped to real, non-bridge rows).

### Changed
- **`+888` (ITU TDR) is now the only fake-address scheme.** The multi-scheme machinery
  (per-scheme parse loop, the `toE164` scheme parameter, the runtime scheme selector) was
  collapsed accordingly.

### Removed
- The deprecated **`+4932` (DE)** and **`+99942` (ITU test)** legacy fake-address schemes,
  including their parse/cleanup paths — a real SMS to such a number can no longer be
  mistaken for a Tesla-bridge message.
- The vestigial Tesla **display-mode / number-scheme** configuration (its switcher was
  already gone): the unused accessors, the dead non-numeric “bracket-form” write path, and
  the related diagnostics UI.
- A batch of dead code surfaced by an audit: unused Room queries (`countForChannel`,
  `refreshExpiry`, `deleteByAddress`, `countSince`, …), the unused `MappingRepository.deleteAll`
  chain, the `ApiCompat` helper, `ToolRegistry.isEmpty`, and assorted stale annotations and
  KDoc links.

### Internal
- Outbound real SMS are guarded by a `SelfSendLedger` so the bridge’s outbox observer never
  treats a user-sent SMS as a Tesla-dictated reply.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **In-car Grok assistant.** A static, Tesla-visible **“Grok”** contact lets the car
  message Grok by voice without opening the app — dictate a question via the car’s
  “reply to message” function and the answer is read aloud. Gated on privacy consent and
  an xAI API key. _Idea by **DaGeneral**._
- **Configurable voice-address contact.** An optional second contact that Tesla’s voice
  control recognises more reliably (a full first + last name). Dictating to it is
  redirected to the Grok session, so **Grok still replies as “Grok.”** Choose a preset
  (**“xAI Grok”** by default, or **“Elon Musk”**), enter a custom name, or switch it off
  — all under **Settings → Grok assistant**.
- `TeslaContactResync`, which forces the car to re-pull the phonebook after contact changes.
- Onboarding step to pick which apps are forwarded.

### Changed
- The Grok **reply name is fixed to “Grok.”**
- No apps are forwarded by default until you select them.

### Removed
- The earlier phonetic **“Grog” / “Grogg”** voice aliases, superseded by the single
  configurable voice-address contact.

### Fixed
- Grok settings text fields dropping keystrokes.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- Initial public release: bridges phone messenger notifications (WhatsApp, Telegram,
  Signal, …) to a Tesla over Bluetooth MAP and routes dictated replies back to the
  originating app.
